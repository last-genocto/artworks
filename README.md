# Last Genocto nannou artworks

This is my working directory with many of the artworks I develop using
[nannou](https://guide.nannou.cc/). The repository also doubles as a
mini-library that wraps a few nannou utilities to make it easy building
animations.

The artworks are in the examples folder. To run a particular artwork, simply run 

``` sh
cargo run --release --example ${NAME}
```
(The release flag is needed to get reasonably fast render and FPS with nannou)

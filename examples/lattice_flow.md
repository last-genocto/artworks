# Lattice flow process

## Motivation

I was initially inspired by [this reddit post on
r/blender](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/zra6sb/changing_perspectives/)
that perfectly loops an array of cubes. The lattice deforms but ends up the same
at the end of the loop, creating a mesmerizing effect. Looking at the comments
under the post, it seems the animations' author was inspired by an [animation by
matthen2](https://twitter.com/matthen2/status/1604391978216595456) which is
based on a Mathematical factlet described on [The n-Category Caf√©
blog](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/04/the_modular_flow_on_the_space.html)

I used nannou to program a similar animation, starting from a grid of objects,
for example circles.
